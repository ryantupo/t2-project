## Configuration

To modify the projectâ€™s configuration:
- **Laravel Environment**: All Laravel configurations (like database and mail settings) can be changed in the `.env` file.
- **Frontend Styling**: Frontend elements are styled using Tailwind CSS, which is compiled using Laravel Mix. Modify any styles in the `resources/css` folder.
- **Mail Setup**: Ensure you configure the mail driver properly as detailed above for the contact form to work.

## Usage

### Contact Form

The **Contact Us** page includes a contact form that allows users to send messages directly to your configured email address. It provides instant feedback to the user with a notification popup that fades out smoothly.

### Adding New Services

To add a new service to the site, you can modify the `services.blade.php` page located in the `resources/views` directory. You can dynamically load more services by extending the layout.

### Image Carousel

The site includes a customizable image carousel that pulls images from specific folders. This is currently implemented on several pages such as **Setting Out Services** and **Surveying Services**. To update the images, simply add or replace images in the respective folder.

## Features

1. **Email Form**:
   - The contact form allows users to send messages directly to the business via email.
   - Styled form fields with validation.
   - Notification popup after a successful form submission.

2. **Dynamic Carousels**:
   - Carousels display images for different services.
   - Easily configurable by adding new images to the `/images/` folder.

3. **Responsive Layout**:
   - Built using Tailwind CSS to ensure compatibility across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
   - Custom layout for each section (services, about us, contact form).

4. **Modern Animations**:
   - Smooth transitions for popup notifications and user interactions.
